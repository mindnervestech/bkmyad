                                                    Google has become so big that sometimes it's difficult to understand just how big it is. It's on course to do $60 billion in revenue this year, almost all of that from advertising. But how big is that in terms of the media it competes against for ad dollars? 

To answer that, Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget presented this slide in his keynote at Ignition 2013 this morning. It shows that Google alone is now bigger than either newspapers and magazines. 

In part this is because the print media has suffered such a precipitous decline. But note that Google's last full year results from 2012 are approaching the historic maximum that all magazines combined achieved back in 2007 before the crash. 

It's won't be long now, in other words, before Google not only eclipses magazines but also becomes bigger than magazines ever were — even when there was no Internet to compete with. 

That's staggering.</p>

                                                    Advertising is the key to success, if a business really wants to thrive and do well in the present world. Every year different advertisers in several countries ensure that they do well and try to make use of the money spent on the whole process. Advertising is not a new concept. Years ago when products were made by hand, people used to use cloth banners, drummers and announcers to get their products into notice and make sales.

 The number of products that are to be sold have many a times outnumbered the people who want to buy it ,this is why the importance of advertising was felt .It soon started to boom. Adverting has since then diversified a lot. It has also gone through the process of segregation. The segregation and diversification both are things which help in identifying the target audience better and help in promoting. Nigeria free ads have changed the picture perceptibly.

 The common perception of this field is that it is a tool of the rich and powerful or of big corporates that want to increase their sales. Another perception attached to this is that people are lured into buying something they do not really need. While this may be true in some cases, the good points and benefits of advertising cannot be ignored.

 This very field is what has made the life of millions easier. These people do not only include those who want to sell their products and services and enhance the value of their brands, they also include those want to buy these products and avail these services.

 Every individual has a set of requirements and the pace of life and the race to keep up with the latest technology has multiplied these needs considerably. These needs can certainly be fulfilled by searching the markets but this can be a long and at times a useless process. It is the use of advertising that tells customers where they can find what they are looking for. It also gives them an insight of the product and an idea of the options. This means of communication is what also helps in letting them know about the best offers, discounts and sale’s promotion tactics.

 Ads are an important means of communication; they let people know what they can buy to fulfil their basic needs and more. To get people to know what is for sale requires money. Promoting brands and products is not an easy job; it needs innovation, time and money. In fact keeping in mind the current rates of slots and space, it needs a lot of money, which is why free ads are a great new thing. These are a great way to achieve the goal a person is set out to do and at the same time save money.</p>
